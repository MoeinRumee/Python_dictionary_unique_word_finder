# Python_dictionary_unique_word_finder

Hey there, Galactic Pioneer! Ready for a challenge? Your mission is to find the five least common words in a given English text. The words should be counted case-insensitively and must be separated by single whitespaces. Assume there is no punctuation. In case there is a tie, simply return words in the order they are stored in your dictionary, don't worry about ties!
